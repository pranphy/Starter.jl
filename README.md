## Julia

This is my foray into Julia for real. Testing stuffs like plots and programming and making packages.

The directory structure is as follows:

  1. `impages` : any images (maybe .tex source files) contaiing graphics.
  2. `prajulia`: a julia package containing my collection of stuffs.
  3. `scripts`: a directory containing various scripts that I write using julia and my packages.
  4. `test`: bunch of small tests performed here
  5. `nb`: jupyter (or other) notebooks for interactive playing.
   
This will updated in the future
